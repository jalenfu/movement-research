    What We Have:
    Foundation for more "complex" movement system
        Momentum, friction, acceleration

    What We Need to Do:
    Develop "simpler" movement system
        Standard velocity rates, fixed dash distance, feels less "floaty"
    Develop ways to test movement systems
        Expand scope to add combat? PvP?
        Add levels/stages
            Ways for movement to interact with environment that feels interesting/responsive
    Controller support

    Concerns:
    What are the best standard practices?
        Am I coding in a way that allows the project to easily expanded upon as more features are added
        I often feel like I'm "hacking in" features as opposed to smoothly implementing them

    Last direction will hold last direction held instead of bool
    Input Handler? will spit out which direction is being held (up left, down right, etc.)
    Battlefield, break the target? (stretch maybe idk)
    How tf does gravity work
